# arva_sim
This ROS package provides the implementation of Gazebo plugins to replicate  the behavior of the [ARVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_transceiver) transceiver systems. In particular, the proposed package contains two different plugins: the _receiver_ and _transmitter_. Considering a specific position for one or more transmitters, the receiver 
calculates the direction of the flux of the magnetic field.

## Background
ARVA system represents one of the forefront technologies nowadays used in _Search & Rescue__ operations in case of avalanches. The ARVA devices consist of two main elements, i.e. a transmitter and a receiver, which are operated alternatively. Excursionists and skiers who use the ARVA normally set in the transmitting mode so that, in the accidental case of avalanche, the system is already set in the right operative mode. In the receiver mode, the ARVA devices provide information about the electromagnetic field, emitted by the transmitter, which is exploited to guide the rescuer toward the victim. 
The working principle of this sensor is based on the detection of the magnetic low-power pulses, emitted by the transmitter. This information is usually made available to the rescuers in terms of magnetic distance and magnetic direction to the victim.

This is an ongoing work. This documentation will be updated as soon as possible.
